Pizza topping selector app for local restaurant

This is a partially-functional web app designed for a local restaurant to use daily. Aspirationally, it is designed to make a random selection of three pizza toppings for the daily special, then log those selections to a table that is hidden by default, with logic to prevent the same toppings from being repeated too often. 

In its current state, it only allows for the manual selection of those toppings, as the randomizer button is currently a placeholder. 

The 'SET' button is also a placeholder, not currently logging to a hidden table, as is the 'Veggies Only?' slider box. This will remove the meat toppings from the randomizer.

The page is designed to aesthetically reproduce the website of the restaurant, as this will ideally eventually be hosted on their page. The reproduction is purely aesthetic, and no code was copied from their page. The only assets used are the background and logo images.

While a work in progress, I believe this site fulfills the requirements of the project while allowing considerable further oppoprtunities for improvements as I learn new skills.

Thank you for reading!
